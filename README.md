The relative aim of this note is to be a collection of, well, \textit{notes} for an  undergraduate reading project at USC. This collection, as of now, will likely go through a specific review of important linear algebra definition and ideas that directly translate to talking about objects in $R$-$\mathbf{Mod}$—since an $R$ module is a vector space when $R = F$ for some field. The most important aspect of this review, likely, will be the translations that: if $M$ is vector space of dimension $n$, then this translates to $M$ being a \textit{free module of rank $n$} over a ring $R$; if $M$ is a finite dimensional vector space, then this translates to $M$ being a finitely generated module—this one is actually easy; if a subset $A$ of $M$ spans $M$, then this translates to a subset, say, $A$ of $M$ \textit{generates} $M$. Beyond this front, some sort of expositional project is required as presentation and so an account of a syzygy may be good choice, but nothing is fixed as of yet. The actual particular goal of this note is, maybe its only use, is the development of theoretical concepts in (co)homological algebra; we'll likely go through the development of, firstly, homology, hom and tensor, projective, injective, and flat modules, derived functors, commuting homology, and sheaf cohomology (hopefully). We'll start talking about hom and tensor.
